# MBTI-Function-Shuffle
This tool will allow anyone to enter a Myers-Briggs type and learn the function stacking associated with it.  Eventually, I will add functionality to compare the relationships between Myers-Briggs types based on different parameters.  This is my first personal coding project and I'm very excited about it!
