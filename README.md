# MBTI-Function-Shuffle
This tool will allow anyone to enter a Myers-Briggs type and learn the function stacking associated with it.  Eventually, I will add functionality to compare the relationships between Myers-Briggs types based on different parameters.  This is my first personal coding project and I'm very excited about it!  Always open to feedback.

I'm also hoping to figure out how to get this to work as a tool on a website or that I can stick into a blog of mine or something.  I'd like to be able to link people to it as a shortcut for anyone interested in better understanding what Myers-Briggs types really indicate.   If anyone has thoughts or advice on the best way to do this, I'd greatly appreciate it!

EDIT: So I found a major flaw in my code (it doesn't work for about a quarter of the types), and then I found a major flaw in my understanding of Myers-Briggs functions, so I'm working on resolving both of those issues.
